# Hybrid Recommender System (SVD + NCF)

This repository contains a **C++ implementation** of a **hybrid recommender system** that combines **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**. It was originally developed as a **CMP2003 "Data Structures & Algorithms"** project on HackerRank, where it achieved **first place**. 

> **Note**: This local version manually splits a sample dataset into `training_data.csv` and `test_data.csv`. The actual competition dataset had ~30,000 rows, and the official test data remains hidden by the competition organizers.

## Introduction

This hybrid recommender system was developed for a HackerRank competition in CMP2003 "Data Structures & Algorithms." Initially, it utilized three components:
1. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
2. **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**  
3. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)**  

Subsequent **performance analyses** revealed that **IBCF** introduced significant computational overhead with only marginal improvement in accuracy. It was consequently **disabled** in favor of a **faster** hybrid approach combining only SVD and NCF.

---

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Model**: Merges **SVD** and **NCF** for better accuracy and speed.
- **Lightweight NCF**: Uses a small embedding dimension (3), reducing computational overhead.
- **Scalable**: Successfully handles datasets of ~30,000 rows.
- **High Performance**: 
  - **RMSE**: ~0.9041  
  - **Runtime**: ~0.0793â€“0.0799 seconds on the competition environment.
- **Configurable Hyperparameters**: Easily adjust factors, dimensions, learning rates, etc.

---

## Performance Adjustment

- The final hybrid system **disabled IBCF** for improved runtime.
- Disabling IBCF resulted in a **marginal drop** in accuracy but a **significant** runtime improvement.

## Technical Overview

### SVD
1. Learns **latent factors** for users and items.
2. Incorporates **user bias** and **item bias**, along with the **global mean** rating.
3. Suited for capturing **linear** relationships in user-item interactions.

### NCF
1. Learns **neural embeddings** for users and items.
2. Captures **non-linear** relationships.
3. Weights the final prediction alongside SVD results.

### IBCF (Disabled)
- Initially used to compute **cosine similarity** between items.
- Found to be **computationally expensive** for larger datasets.
- Disabled to prioritize **speed**.

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Prepare Data**:
   - Provide two CSV files:
     - `training_data.csv` with columns: `userId, itemId, rating`
     - `test_data.csv` with columns: `userId, itemId`
   - Make sure to adjust these paths as needed if they differ from the default.
3. **Build** (using a C++17 compiler or later):
    ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o recommender
    ```
4. **Run** the executable: 
    ```bash
   ./recommender
    ```
5. After training, the program reads from `test_data.csv` and writes predictions into:
    ```bash
    predicted_ratings.csv
    ```
    In the form:
    ```bash
    userId,itemId,predictedRating
    ```
6. **Inspect Output:** The final predictions are clamped between 0 and 5.

## Further Observations

1. **Embedding Dimension**: A dimension of 3 for NCF was found sufficient to capture essential interaction features while maintaining speed.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiments revealed a need to balance model complexity (e.g., increasing SVD factors or embedding dimensions) and performance; higher complexity can lead to overfitting or slower runtime.
3. **IBCF Exclusion**: Disabling IBCF lowered accuracy slightly but drastically improved runtime, justifying its removal for this project.
